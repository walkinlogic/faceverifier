you want to detect if a profile image is valid for a passport.

When we talk about a "valid passport photo," it usually means checking some of these criteria:

Face detection: There must be exactly one clear face.

Frontal pose: Face must look straight at the camera (not tilted or turned).

Neutral expression: No smiles or exaggerated expressions (optional, depending on country).

Background: Plain, usually white or off-white.

Lighting: Even lighting without shadows.

Head size and position: Head must occupy a certain percentage of the photo area (like 50-69% for some countries).

No accessories: No hats, glasses (unless allowed), etc.

Image quality: High resolution, not blurry.

How to detect this automatically?
You would typically combine:

Face Detection (using something like OpenCV, dlib, or deep learning models).

Pose Estimation (check if the face is straight).

Background Detection (check if background is uniform).

Size and Bounding Box Check (head should be appropriately sized in the frame).

Optional: Train a model on valid vs invalid passport photos for finer checks.
